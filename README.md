# 🏧 ATM Simulation in Python

## 🔹 Overview
This project is a **Python-based ATM (Automated Teller Machine) simulation** that allows users to perform basic banking operations such as checking balance, depositing money, and withdrawing money.  
It demonstrates the use of Python fundamentals like conditionals, loops, functions, and file/database handling (if implemented).

## 🎯 Purpose
The purpose of this project is to:
- Simulate a real-world ATM system in Python  
- Practice core programming concepts  
- Understand user authentication and transaction handling  
- Provide a beginner-friendly project for learning  

## ⚙️ Tech Stack
- **Programming Language:** Python 3  
- **Modules Used:** (e.g., `os`, `getpass`, `sqlite3` if used)  
- **IDE/Notebook:** Jupyter Notebook / VS Code / PyCharm  

## 📂 Features & Highlights
- 🔑 User login/authentication (PIN system)  
- 💰 Check account balance  
- ➕ Deposit money  
- ➖ Withdraw money (with balance check)  
- 📜 Transaction summary/receipt (if implemented)  
- ❌ Exit option to end session
